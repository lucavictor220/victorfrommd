        The world is changing faster than our human nature can adapt. Think about it! Think about the changes that have happened in the last 30 years and how it shaped our lives. Take into consideration that 30 years is a drop of water in the ocean of human evolution and adaptation to the environment. In the last 30 years, we witnessed the rise of the Internet which democratised access to information and changed forever almost all industries. We changed the way we travel.  Using physical maps is a thing of the past. Today, you can prepare for a trip to another country from one day to another. To learn a new recipe, you no longer need to ask your grandma. In a matter of seconds, you can open a Youtube video and learn any recipe of any cuisine in the world. Acquiring new things, be it sofa, groceries or a lamp for you kitchen, might be a matter minutes. On top of that, you might have all the above delivered within hours or maximum days. Waiting for your grocery delivery app for more than 3 seconds, drives us nuts and makes us think about this stupid developers that can’t even build a good app. All in all, we’re living in an unbelievably high pace world with high expectations from every aspect of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>The implications of this high pace world and high expectations are messing up our human psyche. The human psyche is responsible for emotions and therefor is responsible for our happiness feeling. </p>
      <p>I don’t like to use the word happiness and being happy. It is an oversimplification of human existence. It is often associated with the question “Are you happy?” which implies a binary answer - you either are happy or not. Our lives are not black and white. Generally the feeling of being happy comes and goes with circumstances of our lives. The answer doesn’t specify the timeframe and leaves no space for happiness tomorrow, in one year or even on your death bed. We all strive to be happy and we should. It makes life exciting and worth living, but we shouldn’t live in the illusion that happiness is something that you either have or you don’t. Or that it something that you can buy with enough money. Or that someone else will bring it on a plate. The feeling of being happy is often perceived in contrast to a negative emotion. For example, when you had a terrible boss for 1 year and you moved departments and suddenly your life feels much better and going to work is not a torture anymore. The perceived feeling of happiness at any given moment is a complex formula that can’t be translated into a cook book recipe. Thus, when you think about yourself and your happiness try to avoid absolute terms and think more in the ratio of positive to negative emotions. If most of your days for an extended period of time you experience negative emotions, that might be a sign that you need help.</p>
      <p>The negative emotions emerge from different sources. Some of them, we don’t have much control over. What we do have control over, is how do we respond to them. Let’s say, you have an important presentation at work and you woke up early. You prepare yourself for the day ahead and go through the slides one last time. You leave the house and you’re on the way to work. Half way through, while being on the train, you hear the announcement from the train operator that due to some accident on the tracks the train have to be delayed by 25 minutes. You look at your watch and realise that even if you left the house 10 minutes earlier than usual, you still might be late to the presentation. The negative thoughts take over you and you start to blame everything and everyone including yourself for this misfortune. The day is ruined and nothing could save it. Could you have done something different and avoid it? It’s hard a exercise, but in this situations you can blame yourself and others as much as you want, but things sometimes doesn’t work the way you want them to. Sometimes we need to surrender to the circumstances to avoid unnecessary negative emotions and suffering. We had this unrealistic expectation that trains come always on time, especially in Germany. Or that if you leave the house earlier, you definitely will make it on time. Or that in the worst case if the train is canceled you’ll order a taxi and it will be alright. Living with such high expectations and believes that somehow you’ll be always on time, be right, look cool or that you deserve a better life than what you have is a recipe to much frustration, disappointment and resentment.</p>
      <p>The modern world creates a lot of myths and illusions about what should happen and how you should feel. Amazon Prime promises same day delivery. The Hollywood movie Trailers create the hype that you’re missing out if you don’t show up on the premier with your friends. The Social Media platforms makes you feel that you’re the only one that is not in shape and single out there. The Dating apps promise you to find the love of your life and unbelievable dating experience and that you shouldn’t settle for anything less than that. I can go on forever, but the point is that modern society overwhelms us with expectations that often are a caricature of objective reality. This constant bombardment with ever growing expectations seeds unconscious frustration with anything less than exciting and extravagant. Our desires and expectations are constantly growing and leave us bored to death when we try to spend time with ourselves. We seek to be constantly entertained by something or someone. The life becomes an eternal game for the best joke, date, movie, job, husband, wife, picture, cake, look, vacation… This is precisely the reason why nowadays, people can spend 20 minutes on Netflix looking for a new movie to watch and give up, because there is nothing in this 3600+ movies and 1.800+ TV shows which is worth their time. We have no way to satisfy our desires and cravings in this game. We are left hopeless in the attempt to win at the game of life. I start to believe that a way forward is to stop wanting more and better, but to embrace and start loving the ordinary.</p>
      <p>A new movement have emerged from the abundance of modern world. It is called minimalism. The minimalists try to think in terms of “Less is more”. A friend of mine said that I live like a Monk. Well, I guess I’m part of this movement. Although, I feel like I’m getting into another extremity which is not good either. The minimalists tend to own less things. This behaviour transcends the physical world and affect our behaviours and feelings. For example, having coffee once or twice a week creates a feeling of scarcity thus amplifying the enjoyment. Trying fasting opens our eyes to the fact that we haven’t actually been hungry for the last couple of months, years or ever. The question that arrises “Is minimalism an antidote to ever growing expectations of modern world? Could it treat you and give you tranquility and happiness?” It’s hard to say for sure. We can’t simply avoid the paradox of choice. At some moment, you have to buy those white T-shirts. Although all of them are white, are they of the same quality? Do they fit you flawlessly? Well, I hope you got my point.</p>
      <p>In this ever faster pacing world that have ever growing expectations, we have to harvest the wisdom of ancient philosophers and search for true sources of happiness. It’s very clear to me that some things, like our psyche, don’t change as fast as the operation system of our iPhones. We have to bear this in mind when we are approaching modern world and ask ourselves if what this world expects of us is something that make sense or an illusion that is sold to us. Perhaps, when we find the wisdom to distinguish between objective reality and perceived reality, we could feel a little bit more happy in our daily lives.</p>
