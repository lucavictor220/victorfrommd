      <h1>Thoughts on climate change</h1>

      <p>
        Climate change used to be controvertial topic back in 2000s. At least,
        this is what I remember. Now, the scientists are quite aligned on the
        evidence of climate change. It is happening and it is happening fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's quickly define what I'm talking about. Climate change is the
        process of change of climate conditions accross the globe that happens
        on much faster pace than ever before due to human activity. It generally
        cause the fenomen of global warming. To me, global warming and climate
        change is the same thing. The key words here are "due to human
        activity". Yes, we are the reason that plannet is changing and we should
        find ways to fix that to have a sustainable future.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is planty of material out there, that allows you to understand
        what is happening. I'll simply things and say that the average
        temperature is raising in most of the regions and that causes changes to
        the natural environment beyond anything natural. For example: extreme
        heats, huricanes, drought etc. To understand why it's so important, we
        have to first acknowledge how lucky we are with our planet Earth. Our
        existence is possible due to good temperature, clean water and fertile
        soil. Now, if one of those falls out of balance, we are basically dead
        or at least in massive extinsion. No more cocktails on nice beaches of
        Hawaii. I think we should all acknowledge that this is an emergency and
        combine our efforts to solve it.
      </p>
      <!-- What causes global warming? -->
      <p>
        What's out there that causes global warming? CO2 emitions according to
        scientists is the primary cause of global warming. CO2 is a gass that we
        produce in huge quantities and according to the science community. 
        Reducing the amount of it that we put into atmosphere would contribute to solving climate change issue. 
        However, what people forget to acknowledge is that it is only half of the problem. 
        We need also to extract the excess of existing CO2 from atmosphere. As you might guess,
        it is a much bigger issue in itself than reducing the CO2 emitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's pin point the main sources of CO2 emissions. One of the main source of
        CO2 emissions is energy production. We burn fossil
        fuels to produce electricy and power human activity. Unfortunetly, it
        also produces a lot of CO2. We should strive to transition as fast as possible
        to cleaner types of energy production to reduce greenhouse gasses (CO2) emitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution might be to increase carbon tax and make sustainable ways of
        production of energy chieper than burning of fossil fuels. We should
        acknowledge as a society that this is the way to go and insentivice
        transition towards sustainable energy production. Europe is on its way
        to do that. Today(2022), 22% of electricy produced in europe is
        harvested through sustanible means like solar, wind and hydro. However,
        Europe is a tiny piece of land comparing to China, India, Pakistan and
        US. To me, every other big country should join the common effort. Again, easier set
        than done. Burning fossil fuels is still a cheaper alternative which are chosen by
        developing countries. Unless we change the unit economics of this, we can't hope
        that countries would switch to sustanible means of energy production.
