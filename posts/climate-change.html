      <h1>Climate change</h1>
      <p>
        Climate change used to be controvertial topic back in 2000s. At least,
        this is what I remember. Now, the scientist are quite aligned on the
        evidence of climate change. It is happening and it is happening fast.

        Let's quickly define what I'm talking about. Climate change is the
        process of change of climate conditions accross the globe that happens
        on much faster pace than ever before due to human activity. It generally
        cause the fenomen of global warming. To me, global warming and climate
        change is the same thing. The key words here are "due to human
        activity". Yes, we are the reason that plannet is changing on such a
        radical and fast pace that haven't been observed previously in the
        history.
