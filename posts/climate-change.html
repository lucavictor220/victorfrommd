        Climate change used to be controvertial topic back in 2000s. At least,
        this is what I remember. Now, the scientist are quite aligned on the
        evidence of climate change. It is happening and it is happening fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's quickly define what I'm talking about. Climate change is the
        process of change of climate conditions accross the globe that happens
        on much faster pace than ever before due to human activity. It generally
        cause the fenomen of global warming. To me, global warming and climate
        change is the same thing. The key words here are "due to human
        activity". Yes, we are the reason that plannet is changing and we should
        find ways to fix that to have a sustainable future.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is planty of material out there, that allows you to understand
        what is happening. I'll simply things and say that the average
        temperature is raising in most of the regions and that causes changes to
        the natural environment beyond anything natural. For example: extreme
        heats, huricanes, drought etc. To understand why it's so important, we
        have to first acknowledge how lucky we are with our planet Earth. Our
        existence is possible due to good temperature, clean water and fertile
        soil. Now, if one of those falls out of balance, we are basically dead
        or at least in massive extinsion. No more cocktails on nice beaches of
        Hawaii. I think we should all acknowledgethat this is an emergency and
        combine our efforts to solve it.
      </p>
      <!-- What causes global warming? -->
      <p>
        What's out there that causes global warming? CO2 emitions according to
        scientist is the primary cause of global warming. CO2 is a gass that we
        produce in huge quantities and according to the science community,
        reducing the amount of it that we put into atmosphere would stop climate
        change. Unfortunetly, its easier said that done. We produce CO2 even
        when we brief. Should we stop briefing?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's pin point the main sources of CO2 emissions. The main source of
        CO2 emissions is not you briefing so you can continue briefing and read
        this article. The primary sector is electricy production. We burn fossil
        fuels to produce electricy and power human activity. Unfortunetly, it
        also produces a lot of CO2. We should stop doing that and find other
        ways to power our industries without producing huge quantities of
        greenhouse gasses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution is to increase carbon tax and make sustainable ways of
        production of energy chieper than burning of fossil fuels. We should
        acknowledge as a society that this is the way to go and insentivice
        transition towards sustainable energy production. Europe is on its way
        to do that. Today(2022), 22% of electricy produced in europe is
        harvested through sustanible means like solar, wind and hydro. However,
        Europe is a tiny piece of land comparing to China, India, Pakistan and
        US. To me, every other big country should do that. Again, easier set
        than done.
