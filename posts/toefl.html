      <h1>TOEFL - just a test or proof of English knowledge?</h1>

        TOEFL is a standardised Test Of English as a Foreign Language which primary is used as means to get enrolled in an English-speaking university. The test is almost 60 years old. I took it myself twice. I received a score of 92 and 93 respectively. Ironically, when I thought that my English improved, I received a score which is 1 point lower than I had it 5 years ago. ü§¶üèª¬†There is a common perception that this is just a test and it doesn‚Äôt necessary reflect your English level skill. I held the same opinion, before taking the test. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The TOEFL test consists of 4 parts: reading, listening, speaking, writing. This format is common to most of the internationally recognised language tests. I had the same format for German test TELC. The total duration of the test is around 3 hours. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The reading section generally consists of 3-4 passages with 30-40 questions and lasts 54-72 minutes. I found this section the most stressful one. First of all, the passages are usually academic material that is way beyond the knowledge that I have on the subject in my native language, let alone in English. Secondly, the time pressure was unbearable. You have a bit less than 2 minutes per question. In this time, you have to understand the question and find the answer in the paragraph. Some of the questions are so called negative factual information. For example: ‚ÄúAll the following are mentioned in the paragraph 3 except‚Ä¶? Mark the answer whose idea is not present in the paragraph‚Äù. With this type of questions, you suddenly have to find not one correct answer, but 3 and then infer which one doesn‚Äôt exist in the paragraph. I‚Äôd say that this kinda‚Äô questions definitely fall into the category of annoyingly smart questions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The listening section lasts for 41-57 minutes and have between 28-39 questions. This section is all about being able to take notes and find important ideas that have been elaborated during the lectures. There are multiple listening passages with subsequent questions about them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The speaking part comes after a break and is the shortness lasting only 17 minutes. In this section, you are requested to talk about a familiar topic and discuss the material you read and listened. For example: there is a passage that you have to read which is followed by a lecture on the same topic. Afterwards, you‚Äôre requested to create a summary of the main ideas from the passage and lecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The writing section was the easiest one to me and it lasted for 50 minutes. I had enough time to write my ideas and even go back and rewrite some of them and correct some grammar mistakes. In this section, is important to come up with a structured draft as fast as possible and then improve it as much as possible in the remaining time. Although I found it the simplest, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend wasting any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you completed the last section, you‚Äôll be presented with a draft of a score for the sections that don‚Äôt require a human to score them. The final score are available on the official website in around 4-8 days.
      </p>

        This test doesn‚Äôt try to defeat you on purpose. Every piece of material to prepare for this test is present on TOEFL‚Äôs official website. There is even sample tests that you can take. They don‚Äôt hide anything from the eyes of the test taker. No secret questions you were not expecting. No weird new section that you haven‚Äôt heard of. They even have a so called home edition. You can take the test in the comfort of your own home. Everything will be exactly the way they said. That‚Äôs the beauty of it. I think this is the beauty of any good test. Even if you knew way more than others you still, most probably, would receive exactly the same score as you deserve. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to cheat on this test. You just don‚Äôt have the time for it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many advices out there in the internet. I will link some of the resources I used. There are many platforms that allow you to prepare for the test. I just want to emphasis one crucial idea - you have to invest time in order to prepare for this test to get a good score. Even if you think that your English is great, it won‚Äôt be enough to meet the requirements of this test.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some things that you‚Äôre not prepared on the day of taking the test. For example, the first section is reading, but before it starts there is a process of adjusting the volume of the microphone in which you have to talk. A small, but important tip for people that can‚Äôt concentrate on the reading while someone else in the room talks, is to wait until other people start talking and not be among the first ones to start reading. Remember that the counter starts ticking only once you see the first text. Another detail, which was very important to me, is that they don‚Äôt provide any alternative keyboard layout support. You‚Äôll use QWERTY. That‚Äôs all you get. For the folks like me that decided to use Colemak or any other alternative layout, this is a big problem. We have to type in the layout that we‚Äôre not anymore comfortable using. It becomes an issue during the writing section. I wonder if it is any different in the home edition of TOEFL test. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, one thing is certain for me now, if you don‚Äôt know English you won‚Äôt fake it by preparing for the test.
