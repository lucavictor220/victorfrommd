      <h2>Revelation</h2>
      <p>
        As Steve Jobs said in his famous speech at Stanford University: <i>"You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward"</i>. There is one revelation that I came to after attending completely random event at Moldavian Embassy in Berlin. The event was about presentation of the book “The Architectural guide Chisinau”. I was invited by an Irish friend of mine which happen to work previously with one of the editors of this book. What are the odds of being invited by an Irish friend to a presentation of the book about my Capital of Chisinau in the Embassy of Moldova in Berlin?
      </p>
      <p>
        During the presentation, I noticed that the Author focused mostly on the Soviet Era and different phases of it. There were many buildings that I’ve recognised and have seen many times. There were a couple of them that I actually haven’t seen and I found them interesting. At that moment, I though to myself “What about our City Hall or Art Museum? Why he doesn’t mention these buildings?” That sparked my interest and by pure luck I received a copy of the book for free, because I forgot something and came back after presentation and one of the people there gave it to me. I came home and spent around 3 hours simply looking through the book and reading passages here and there. After going through the entire book, I still haven’t found a picture of our City Hall. At this moment, I realised that it makes actually sense. The buildings are so different from the Soviet Architecture that they must have been build before that. I went on Google and started to research about some of the buildings that I had in my mind. To my surprise, I found out that the master minds behind City Hall and many other buildings are Carol Schmidt and Architect Alexander Bernardazzi. After reading about these people the book suddenly made more sense. The buildings that stand out in Chisinau have been built during the longest ever mandate of major Carol Schmidt. You don’t have to be genius to realise that those buildings are different from anything else in vicinity, but despite this fact, I never turned to Google to find out more about them and the master minds behind them. Also, interesting fact is that Carol Schmidt was of German descendants. Thus, we could say, to my surprise, that Chisinau had once a German Major. What could be more German than the name Carol Schmidt?

      <h2>Soviet Era</h2>
      <p>To give a bit of perspective about how different are the buildings build during Carol Schmidt times, I want to present our typical buildings of Soviet Era:</p>

      <p>
        The above buildings are typical monuments of Soviet Era that you can observe all around the Capital. The typical "Khrushchyovka" or "Brezhnevka" residential buildings could be found all around capital:

        I’d characterise this buildings as lacking soul. They are grey boxes that stay as monument to political experiment of 20th century to build communism. There are though quite a few which are actually very cool in my opinion:

      <p>Thus, I’m not trying to say that all Soviet buildings are dull and ugly, but I’d say that most of them have no soul, so to put it.</p>

      <h2>Carol Schmidt major mandate (1877-1903)</h2>
      <p>Carol Schmidt was born in a family of German Bassarabians. That’s the reason his house has German inscriptions to this day:</p>

      <p>
        Carol Schmidt was an intellectual that started his studies at Faculty of Physics and Mathematics in Kiev and completed a doctorate in Law in Odesa. During that times, nowadays territory of Republic of Moldova, have been part of Russian Empire.  During his mandate he dreamed to transform Chisinau into a city deemed to be called Capital of Bessarabia Governorate. When he took over his mandate as major of Capital, there were no paved roads, public transport, lights, water supply and cultural centers. To put it simply, before his mandate, the city was simply a commercial hub where people were selling different goods on the market. With his efforts, he achieved his dream and Chisinau became part of top 20 biggest cities in Russian Empire. Besides that, it became a cultural hub of the region, in pace with many European cities at that time. All of this, have been achieved in his 26 years of his mandate. This is simply unbelievable. One person with good intentions and strong will achieved an unimaginable transformation of the city. Let's explore some of the buildings that stand to this day:

        This are just some of the examples that I find elegant, beautiful and having a soul. This buildings bring joy to look at. The architecture style is so far away from the Soviet Era, that you could think that this pictures are taken in some other city. Perhaps, some city in Germany or France.
      </p>
      <p>
        The buildings constructed during Carol Schmidt's mandate reflect the transformation of Chisinau from a market, into a cultural hub. These structures, designed by Alexander Bernardazzi, showcase elegance and soul, standing out from the typical Soviet-era monuments that dominate the city. From the City Hall to the Water Tower and the Museum of Art, these buildings evoke a sense of European charm and serve as a testament to Schmidt's vision and achievements. When Carol Schmidt suddenly resigned in 1903, Chisinau had paved streets, illumination on the streets, first line of tram, churches, schools, water supply, parks and museums.

      <h2>Connecting the dots</h2>

      <p>My parent’s house where I lived for a little bit more than 20 years, is overlooking an ex-jews cemetery which nowadays is a beautiful public park. It's the place I've been running around as a kid which I know by heart. As a teenager, my main activity was playing football on a dusty and dirty football stadium at that time.</p>

      <img src="https://ea.md/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photo_2020-11-17-10.20.12.jpeg" alt="Alunelul Park (ex-jewish cemetery)">

      </div>

      <p>
        There is one monument that I’ve seen numerous of times in that Park, but didn’t know the importance of it until I was way into my 20s. I knew it’s some kinda of jewish monument, but that’s it. 
      </p>

      <div class="image-description">
        <span>Monument to victims of Pogrom of 1903</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        Sadly, for my culture, this monument stands out as a reminder of our dark past and is the reason Chisinau is quite “famous” in the Jewish community. The monument is dedicated to the Jewish Pogrom of 1903, a bloody event in which 49 Jews were murdered, almost 100 were badly injured, women were raped, over 500 were lightly injured, and 1,500 homes were damaged. At the time of the Pogrom, Jews constituted 46% of the total population of 110,000. It’s a tragic story in itself, and I encourage people to read about it. It was the beginning of tragic events for Jews in the 20th century and served as a premise for the Zionist movement. The Pogrom of 1903 highlights the importance of education in the prosperity of any country and presents an example of how a mere gossip turned into a cruel bloodshed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Pogrom happened during the time of Carol Schmidt. He was heartbroken to see how citizens of the city he had invested so much time in transforming could have such a savage mentality and resigned. This was his way to protest and express solidarity with this tragic event.
      </p>

      <p>
        Translated from Romanian is a passage from Wiki which talks about this event in the eyes of Carol Schmidt:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The pogrom against the Jews in Chisinau in April 1903 was the last straw that broke the camel's back and led Carol Schmidt to resign. He, who had done so much for the Europeanization of the city, could not conceive that the inhabitants here could have such a savage mentality. That was his reason for resigning. A sensitive and cultured man like him was incompatible with the black hundreds who dictated the political fashion of the day. No other lesson could be given to the townspeople than resignation...</i>
      </p>
      
      <h2>The End</h2>
      <p>
        The Pogrom of 1903 led to the resignation of Carol Schmidt and the end of the longest mayoral mandate in Chisinau's history. Most scholars agree that his mandate is associated with the greatest transformation of the city. The city was transformed from a market place to a cultural capital, aligned with many European cities at the time. Carol Schmidt was the best mayor that Chisinau has ever had. I'm proud that we have preserved most of his and Alexander Bernardazzi's heritage. I hope that more people from Chisinau, as well as tourists, will know about him and, while passing by his house proudly standing in the city center, will express gratitude towards a man who has done so much for what Chisinau is today.
