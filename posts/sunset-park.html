        This novel lays in a category of novels that I couldn't understand earlier in my life.
        This novel is lacking action, but is full of character description. Description that creates a vivid picture of the
        physical as well as emotional state of each character. 
        The author describes how certain events that happen change people's behaviour and outlook on life. 
        It’s a story about life’s ups and downs and how human's cope with them.

        The main character Miles Heller runs away after a tragic event in which he accidentally kills his step brother.
        It was pure accident, but that fact doesn't save him from the heaviness of the situation and realisation that his brother is dead
        and he was partially responsible for it. 
        He tries to process what happened and to forgive himself first, before trying to earn the forgiveness of his parents. 
        He spends his time in Florida working in a company that resells apartments that have been abandoned for a variety of reasons. 
        He has an unusual hobby of taken pictures of those apartments. To capture something that use to be a home to somebody, 
        but now is full of dust, broken glass, cups, plates and furtuniture. Mile's live take an unusual turn when he meets a very young girl Pilar and fells for her. 
        He’s mostly concern to help her get a scholarship and be accepted at a good college. Her mind is older than her body. He nurtures her curiosity and recommends books. 
        After some time, he literally bribes her out from her sisters. 
        That bites him back, when her sister demands something that will get him in big trouble and pushes him to move back to New York 
        to an area called Sunset Park where Pilar’s evil sister won’t find him. He moves in a house that belong to no one and 
        together with 3 others pretend to be the owners. The author describes the stories around those characters 
        and how they end up accepting such a terrifying perspective of being escorted by the police out of the house on Sunset Park.

        What strikes me about this story is how beautifully it is written. This reminds me of the power that words have on us. It also
        reminds me that my English vocabulary could and need to be improved. Our lives are not written in black and white colors(Although, this blog page is ^_^). There
        are so many shades of colors that we can persive and that can be conveyed using words. Also, this novel surprised me by the brutal realism style in which it was written. It
        doesn't hide anything as we usually do to be polite, respectul or avoid being vulnerable.
        It’s amazing how much of what it feels to be human is captured by 4 characters and their stories. It’s more than just a novel… 
        It’s a story of human existence and inevitable tragedy of it. 
        It’s a story of events that change someone forever without a way back. I found this story deeply touching and highly recommend to anyone who have above average level of English. 
        What also strikes me about this book is that it was written by a contemporary author. I thought that nowadays everyone writes in a very simplistic way inlined with our
        "business" of our lives. That can’t be said about Paul Auster. His writing style is beautiful, reach and deeply touching.
